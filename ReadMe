This repository is created in UCSD's CSE 15L--Software Tools and Techniques Lab. The goal is to showcase everything we learned within five lab reports. 
Lab Report #1: Remotely connecting to ieng6 (UCSD's server) and utilizing Unix commands.
Lab Report #2: Testing Git Hub's version control to debug markdown files.
Lab Report #3: Reducing the need to type tedious commands such as your username and password every time you need to SSH. 
Lab Report #4: Highlighting my thought process when debugging.
Lab Report #5: Using bash scripts to automatically handle a large amount of tests.
