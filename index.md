* Lab Report #1: Remotely connecting to ieng6 (UCSD's server) and utilizing Unix commands.
* Lab Report #2: Testing Git Hub's version control to debug markdown files.
* Lab Report #3: Reducing the need to type tedious commands such as your username and password every time you need to SSH. 
* Lab Report #4: Highlighting my thought process when debugging.
